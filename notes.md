PUBLIC FINANCE

```
As economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, points out, our lives are significantly influenced by
government activities from the moment we are born. Many of us are born in state hospitals, and our birth
is registered by the government, giving us certain rights and responsibilities as citizens of our country.
Most of us receive education in state schools and may benefit from government scholarships or health
support. We all contribute to the government through taxes, and some of us may even be employed by
the state. The standards of what we eat, drink, and the quality of our living spaces are determined and
regulated by the government. We use public transportation on roads built by the government, and even
the collection of our garbage is often managed by a government organization.
Why does the government engage in certain economic activities and not others? Why does the scope of
government activities change over the years and vary from country to country? Public finance addresses
these questions. It examines government expenditures and revenues. A portion of a country's national
income is used by the government to finance public expenditures. These expenditures, regulated by a
public budget, are organized and implemented by public sector units to meet the public service demands
reported by these units. Public sector units are bureaucratically organized administrative structures
working to provide services needed by the public.
Understanding the concept of the state and its role in the economy is essential for a better grasp of public
finance.

Definition of Public Finance
When considering public finance as a whole, it can be classified into parts: public expenditures,
government revenues, borrowing, public budget, fiscal policy, and fiscal law. Among these, public
expenditures represent the money spent by the government to meet societal needs.
Government revenues, on the other hand, are the funds collected by the government to finance public
expenditures. The difference between expenditures and revenues is covered through borrowing. The
comprehensive document that displays these components is called the budget. The budget serves as the
financial balance sheet showing the government's annual monetary transactions, including income,
expenditures, borrowing, and interest payments.
Fiscal policy, a crucial part of public finance, involves the government using its fiscal policy tools to
stabilize the economy, ensure fair income distribution, and implement policies for growth and
development.

Finally, fiscal law is a branch of legal science that examines, from a legal perspective, the income the state
obtains and the expenses it incurs to meet public services. It's crucial because the state cannot collect
income or make expenditures at will. To collect taxes, the parliament must pass laws specifying the
subject, taxpayer, and rate of the tax. Similarly, when utilizing public resources, expenditures must
adhere to certain legal regulations.
Economics: Public finance interacts directly with economics. Government interventions through taxes
and expenditures influence the market. Taxes affect national income, and government spending,
depending on its nature, can boost the economy differently.
Law: Legal principles guide the collection of public revenues like taxes and the expenditure of public
funds. Public finance operates within the boundaries set by laws, and the legal dimension is studied
under fiscal law.
Political Science: Public finance is intertwined with politics. Political decisions shape income,
expenditure, and borrowing. Elected representatives decide on the type and quantity of public services
based on budget approval, a process aligned with democratic principles.
Accounting: The relationship with accounting arises from the financial nature of events. Public finance,
like the private sector, uses accounting to calculate revenues, expenses, and budget deficits or surpluses.
Sociology and Psychology: Public finance is closely related to sociology and psychology. Governments
consider social and individual reactions when implementing taxation policies to minimize negative
responses. Understanding social structures is crucial for addressing dissatisfaction among different social
groups. Additionally, considering the psychology of taxpayers is essential for effective tax collection,
borrowing, and spending.

When considering the structure of societies, it becomes evident that the state holds indispensable
importance. People, being social beings with a tendency to live collectively, inherently possess concepts
of "right" and "wrong." They aspire to live within a framework of what is deemed "right" and seek
prevention against those who act "wrongly." Hence, the existence of authority to establish rules and
ensure their compliance is essential.
In a society, the only power capable of maintaining order and security, prohibiting harmful behaviors
through laws, and enforcing compliance with these laws is the state. The multifaceted and abstract
nature of the state makes it challenging to provide a singular definition, leading to various definitions in
the literature.
According to a narrow definition, the state is "a community of people living under one authority in a
specific territory." A broader definition characterizes the state as "an institution in a society sharing a
common life and culture, aiming to regulate and provide security, welfare, and peace through the
creation and enforcement of laws, adjudication, and punishment."
The Role and Definition of the State
One approach to defining the state perceives it as a natural institution or organization, rooted in Plato's
views. The state is considered an outcome of humans coming together, forming a large human or
organismic continuation. This perspective suggests that the state mirrors the three-part soul concept
composed of reason, spirit, and desire found in individuals.
Another approach, influenced by Aristotle, views the state as a system of institutions and services. In this
perspective, the state possesses a distinct existence from those who govern it. However, those governing
the state contribute to the development and empowerment of this system through decisions and
authority.
A third approach defines the state as an entity and tool created through a social contract. This viewpoint
is influenced by the ideas of Rousseau, Hobbes, and Locke. According to them, individuals cannot exist in
a state of unlimited freedom. Hence, through a social contract, people come together to form a society,
appointing a power as an arbiter and administrator to represent their common will.
Lastly, the Marxist perspective sees the state as a type of governance machinery serving the interests of
the dominant class in society. Policies are formulated based on the interests and preferences of those
holding state power, aligning with the interests of the ruling class. This approach stems from the idea of a
class-divided society, where the state acts as an instrument of oppression for the economically superior
class. In conclusion, the state's definition varies based on different philosophical and sociological
perspectives, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted nature and role in
society.
Concept of the State
Human needs are divided into individual and societal needs. Individual needs, like eating, drinking, and
housing, are those a person can fulfill on their own. Societal needs, on the other hand, arise from people
living together and include education, health, and security. When societal needs go unmet, chaos and
unrest prevail in society. Therefore, an organized force is needed to meet these needs, and in today's
world, this force is called the state.
Ensuring the continuity of a society without a state is impossible. Without a central government,
establishing national defense, implementing a legal system to address injustice, and helping the
homeless and needy lead their lives become challenging.
Meeting basic needs such as travel by road, learning to read and write through education, and having
social security in times of aging and inability to work are nearly impossible without the state. Services
requiring substantial financing, like healthcare, higher education, elderly care, and child care, cannot be
provided without state incentives.
Despite facing high taxes and monetary penalties, and undergoing numerous exams to secure a job or
enroll in a good school, we realize the indispensability of the state when considering the above societal
needs. In this regard, the state is a political organization that meets societal needs, establishes social
order, and ensures stability. Its sole purpose is to enhance societal well-being, and through its absolute
power, it creates and enforces laws.

The human component of the state is formed by the nation. The concept of a "nation-state," rooted in the
idea that each nation should have control over its destiny, has become prevalent today. The existence of
the state is primarily dependent on the presence of a human community. The desire and capability of
individuals forming the state to organize themselves as an independent political entity are more critical
than the number of people in the community. States can vary widely, from those with populations in the
billions, like China and India, to those with populations in the thousands, such as the Principality of
Monaco or the Emirate of Kuwait. Throughout history, different names like subjects, community, or
people have been given to the human element of the state, depending on the development of the concept
of the state.
Territory
The land component of the state is constituted by the territory. The state is defined by the geographical
area that sets the boundaries of the exercise of power. For a state to exist, there must be a distinct country
separated by specific borders from other states. States emerged as societies abandoned nomadic life and
settled in a particular territory as their homeland. Throughout history, with the development of
civilizations, the importance of the territorial element has increased.
Sovereignty
Sovereignty forms the power component of the state. The most significant difference distinguishing the
state from non-state communities is its ability to use sovereignty, which is the dominance, command, and
direction of the behaviors of others, as a political element termed public power. Through armed forces
like the military, gendarmerie, police, and similar forces under its command, the state can exercise
sovereignty. Sovereignty has two aspects: internal and external. Internal sovereignty encompasses all
individuals, groups, and authorities within the country, constituting a superior force derived from the
state itself. External sovereignty implies that the state is not dependent on other states and is legally
equal to them. The state does not derive sovereignty from another authority and does not use it on behalf
of others. However, sovereignty is not unlimited; its nature and boundaries are defined by law.

Over time, as societal needs evolved, the state budget expanded, and public expenditures and revenues
gained a significant share in the market. Consequently, considering the dynamic development in
response to human needs, it can be said that public finance is in a constant state of evolution.
Initially, societal needs were collectively met with a small budget and a cooperative approach, but as time
passed, this changed. In ancient societies, voluntary contributions, such as physical and in-kind
donations, gave way to obligatory contributions like taxes.
Examining the development of public finance through the lens of taxation, changes in tax collection
become apparent with the evolution of money. In ancient societies where money had not yet been
invented, services were compensated through physical and in-kind taxes collected from the people.
Physical sacrifices involved the labor of the people, such as serving as soldiers or working in infrastructure
projects. In-kind sacrifices included offering agricultural products and animals to the ruler. Public services
in ancient times were primarily focused on ensuring security through defense services, establishing courts
for justice, constructing temples for religious obligations, and building hospitals for healthcare services.
Moving into the Middle Ages, a significant change in taxes was observed, where tax collection shifted from
in-kind to monetary, and tax revenues became more structured. During this period, total public revenues
were dominated by income from agricultural activities and property, while royal desires played a
determining role in public expenditures. As parliamentary systems were not yet established during that
era, decisions regarding financial matters affecting the public were within the ruler's authority.
Around the mid-15th century, significant changes distinguish the New Age era from previous periods.
These developments can be categorized into three main points. Firstly, there was a shift in tax collection
methods, transitioning from an in-kind economy to a cash economy. Secondly, the shift to a monetary
economy led to increased economic opinions on financial and economic matters, resulting in a more
rational literature on public revenues and expenditures. This marked the beginning of scientific thinking
playing a more prominent role in solving economic and financial issues during the New Age. The third
development involved granting more say to the public on financial matters.
The most profound change in public finance occurred with the Industrial Revolution in the late New Age.
Before the Industrial Revolution, economic activities were organized around small workshops and family
lands. However, the shift to mass production during the Industrial Revolution caused a significant
expansion in both the quantity and quality of public finance. The previous production style, where
villages transported harvested agricultural products to nearby areas, and small businesses in cities met
only local needs, required minimal involvement from the government.
With the emergence of large-scale production and marketing activities during the Industrial Revolution,
the state and public finance experienced growth both quantitatively and qualitatively. The new era
demanded qualified personnel for production, transportation networks for marketing goods, and largescale energy plants to meet production energy needs. Consequently, the obligation for the state to
provide a wide range of public services, from communication and transportation to education and health,
contributed to the growth of public expenditures and the necessary revenue to finance them.
Another factor contributing to the growth of the state is the evolving economic views on the expansion of
government activities. The minimal state concept advocated by Physiocrats and Classical economists
hindered the development of public finance during that period. However, the explanations of economic
events by Keynes and other Keynesian perspectives, along with the thoughts of Neo-Classical economists
on market failure, became significant intellectual developments contributing to the progress of public
finance.
Keynesian economic views and recommendations on public finance were further developed by
economists like Alvin Hansen and Abba Lerner in the subsequent years, contributing to the development
of functional finance. The traditional fiscal approach considered taxes and borrowing as financing tools,
but the functional finance approach attributed different functions to these tools, accepting them as
means to achieve full employment and price stability in the economy.
In this context, the functional finance approach likened a market without government intervention to a
car without a driver, emphasizing that the government would be more successful in reaching desired
goals and controlling the market with public finance tools.
When evaluating the historical development of public finance, until the 1930s when the liberal economic
perspective was prevalent, and a minimal state approach was adopted worldwide, public expenditures
remained at a low level. However, from the 1930s to 1980, there was a substantial increase. In the 1930s,
public expenditures accounted for approximately 10% of the national income, reaching 16% by 1980.
However, from the 1980s, especially led by developing countries, there was a slowdown in the increase of
public expenditures through privatizations, particularly in years marked by market liberalization. In some
countries, there was even a decline in public spending. Today, the share of global public expenditures in
the gross national income remains around 17%, a trend that hasn't significantly changed since the 1980s.
The questioning of the role of the state in the economy, particularly its share in the 1980s, has its roots in
the 1960s and 70s. Criticisms from schools of thought such as Monetarism, Supply-Side Economics, and
Public Choice Theory regarding the expanding functions of the state led to the scrutiny of the
effectiveness of public finance. In countries where public deficits and debt became unsustainable during
that period, the tax burden on production increased, the sluggish public sector pushed the private sector
out of the market, and resources began to be used inefficiently.
While criticisms about the large scale of public finance and inefficient use of resources persist, societal
needs continue to grow, and meeting these needs is expected from the government. For instance, when
garbage isn't collected every other day in front of our homes or when deep potholes form on the roads,
we hold the government responsible. Therefore, it can be said that the increasing importance of public
finance will continue in the future, just as it does today.
Globalization and Public Finance
There are two different perspectives on how globalization will impact the functions of the state. The first
view suggests that globalization will weaken the state's functions, narrow its authority, and transfer
significant political power to international institutions. The second view argues that while globalization
may lead to a loss of certain powers for the state, it creates an environment where a stronger nation-state
is needed in other areas.
Examining global developments related to globalization reveals that it both reduces and increases certain
functions of the state. In financial markets, the state's role in social welfare functions has diminished
noticeably. Attempts to keep labor costs low for international competitiveness have been observed,
impacting wages. However, this is primarily reflected in reducing burdens on capital. While the scope of
the welfare state has decreased somewhat, it hasn't experienced a significant decline in many
industrialized countries. Changes have occurred in the financing of social welfare services, emphasizing
individual private retirement and health insurance.
One obstacle to the international free movement of capital, a crucial element of globalization, was the
high taxation of capital income. States faced a dilemma between generating tax revenue and attracting
capital inflows into the country. Consequently, taxes on capital have been reduced, leading to a decrease
in the state's role in income redistribution and, in some countries, a slight deterioration in income
distribution.
Globalization and Public Finance
The increasing functions of the state in the era of globalization include:
• Investing in research and development crucial for competition and efficiency in global markets.
• Providing incentives necessary for companies to stay competitive.
• Engaging in regulatory activities to protect property rights and establish the legal framework for
privatization.
In conclusion, it can be said that globalization has not reduced the functions of the state but has caused
significant changes. These changes are expected to continue in the future.

There are significant differences between a market economy and a public economy. Before delving into
these differences, it's crucial to understand the relationship between these two sectors. The public sector
serves as the provider of public services. Households and firms, which benefit from public services and
constitute the private sector, pay taxes. The government, in turn, uses these collected taxes to purchase
production factors from the market and employs them to meet societal needs. The most crucial difference
between the public and private sectors is that the private sector addresses individual needs, while the
public sector addresses societal needs. The methods these sectors employ to meet these needs differ, as
explained below.
Both the government and the private sector require resources such as buildings, labor, machinery, and
equipment to produce goods and services. Thus, when one sector uses these resources, the other may be
deprived of them. The question arises: how much of the resources should the public sector use compared
to the private sector? The answer is not straightforward and depends on factors such as a country's level
of development, governance style, the benefit and cost levels of public goods, and more.
For example, according to Higgins, the answer should consider the benefit obtained from the use of
resources by the public and private sectors. If the benefit citizens gain from public services exceeds the
cost they bear through taxes, it can be said that the public sector contributes positively to the economy.
However, if the marginal benefit provided by the resources used in the public sector falls below the
marginal benefit obtained by the private sector, a reduction in the public sector may be necessary.
A similar view is presented by A.C. Pigou and H. Dalton, suggesting that the social optimum is reached
when the marginal social benefit equals the marginal sacrifice for public services. When the marginal
social costs exceed a certain point, government activities become a burden to society, and the public
sector's role in the economy should shrink.
Brochier and Tabatoni propose a cost comparison approach, emphasizing that the decision on who
produces goods and services should be based on costs. They argue that the sector producing these goods
and services at the lowest cost should be responsible for meeting societal needs. Colin Clark, measuring
the efficiency of the public sector in countries, advocates for a maximum of 25% of the economy's size to
be allocated to the public sector. He suggests that exceeding this limit negatively impacts private sector
production and investment.
Comparison of Market Economy and Public Economy
In a market economy, private sector organizations and individuals play a crucial role. This sector involves
markets where producers and consumers interact. When we talk about the private sector or producers,
we mean entities like companies, financial institutions, and agricultural businesses. On the other hand,
individuals constitute the consumer segment, demanding the goods and services produced. While
individuals act as consumers in the market economy, they take on the role of voters in the political
decision-making mechanism of the public sector.
The public sector comprises government institutions that produce goods and services with high social
benefits. This includes general budget organizations producing non-priced fully public goods, special
budget organizations producing priced semi-public goods, regulatory institutions overseeing the free
market, social security institutions established based on the principle of social welfare, and local
administrations meeting the community's local needs.
The key criterion distinguishing goods and services produced by market and public economies is whether
the benefits provided by these goods are internal or external. Some goods only provide benefits to the
individual consumer, like a pair of shoes that only one person can wear. These goods are produced by the
market economy. In contrast, public economy offerings, such as defense and justice services, involve
external benefits that spread across the entire society, making pricing impractical. Consequently, the
government is the sole provider of such goods.
Market and public economies differ in several aspects. While the market economy primarily operates to
generate profit, the primary goal of the public economy is to maximize societal welfare. In the market
economy, companies conduct feasibility studies before making investment decisions, opting out if the
return on invested capital is not more profitable than alternative returns. In contrast, the public economy
focuses on the social return on expenditure when deciding on production. Therefore, activities such as
justice, defense, and diplomacy, which may not be economically profitable and lucrative in the market
economy, are carried out by the government.
Another distinction between the market and public sectors is related to the type and quantity of goods
produced. In a market economy, decisions about what to produce and how much are made through the
price mechanism by producers and consumers. In the public economy, political decision-making
mechanisms determine the type and quantity of production.
Financing goods is another difference between the two economies. In a market economy, goods and
services are financed by consumers since they are produced to meet private needs. In the public sector,
the financing of goods produced is from the budget, especially when the benefits of these goods cannot
be divided and priced. When benefits can be divided, and pricing is feasible, financing is partly from the
budget and partly in the form of user fees.
In addition to these points, differences in goods and services produced by market and public economies
can be summarized as follows:
In a market economy, consumption decisions are freely made, varying based on the consumer's income
level, preferences, and personal utility. In goods produced by the public sector, consumption is
mandatory.
Determining the unit price for goods and services produced in a market economy is easy. In the public
economy, as the division of benefits is difficult or even impossible, the unit price cannot be determined.
Individual tastes and preferences drive goods and services
in a market economy. Public goods and services, however,
are presented to the entire community.
Competition conditions apply to goods and services
produced in a market economy. In the public sector,
competition is often absent as the state holds a monopoly
in many cases.
While institutions addressing public needs are legally
established, there is no such obligation for meeting private
needs. Entry into the market (mobility) is free.

Throughout different periods of history, various perspectives have been put forward regarding the origin
and emergence of the state. These views are heavily influenced by societies, ideologies, and intellectual
traditions. In many cases, these perspectives see the existence of the state as a necessity, arguing that it is
a crucial institution for human happiness, peace, and fulfilling needs. Below, we discuss the approaches
of different economic movements regarding types of states and the necessity of the state within this
context.
Should the government interfere in the economy? And
if so, to what extent?
When we examine today's existing economic systems, we can see that these systems are primarily based
on two main models. These are the capitalist system (market economy) and the socialist system
(command economy). Below, brief information about these systems is provided.
The Capitalist System's View on Government Activities
The foundations of the capitalist system were laid by political economists like Adam Smith, David Ricardo,
and John Stuart Mill.
At the core of the capitalist system, also known as the free-market system, is the idea of "let them make
beer, let them pass." In this system, producers and consumers decide which goods will be produced, in
what quantity, and for whom through the price mechanism, and state intervention in the market is not
welcomed.
Another concept closely associated with capitalism and a presumption of classical economics is the
metaphor of the "invisible hand." According to this metaphor, every economic unit in the market, while
working for its own interest, unintentionally contributes to the benefit of society. Built on the assumption
of perfect competition, this approach argues that prices formed based on supply and demand 'clear the
market.
Economic Perspective on the Concept of the State
Views on Socialist Order and Government Activities
The foundations of the socialist order, also known as socialism or a totalitarian system, were laid by Karl
Marx. The essence of the system is the dominance of the state in the market and production decisions. In
this regard, the government decides what to produce, how to produce, for whom, and in what quantity.
Another distinctive feature of socialist economies is the public ownership of the means of production.
While in the capitalist system, production, investment, and distribution decisions are made by the market
mechanism based on the profit and benefit approach of producers and consumers, in socialist
economies, these decisions are made by the central planning organization, taking into account the
development dynamics of the country.
Views on Government Activities in a Mixed Economic System
Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen's gravity model suggests that over time, the good and bad features of
socialist and capitalist systems will converge, giving rise to a mixed economic order.
From an economic rationality perspective, it is argued that both sectors should complement each other in
the market. The government should engage in activities where the private sector is insufficient, and,
conversely, in sectors where the government should step back, the private sector activities should
expand.
Economic Perspective on the Concept of the State
Samuelson, for instance, argues that some goods, which cannot be divided and are not feasible for
private sector production, should be produced by the government. Additionally, there is a need for
government intervention in the provision of semi-public goods, as relying solely on the private sector can
lead to either under or overproduction of these goods.
Economic Approaches
Over time, economic theories that were once considered mainstream have given way to alternative
perspectives. The main reason for the impermanence of economic ideas is the lack of sustainable
methods for overcoming crises within economic systems. In fact, some economic systems may contain
potentials that contribute to crises. Below, we highlight some of the important systems in this context.
Economic Perspective on the Concept of the State
Mercantilist ideas became widespread in Western Europe in the 16th
century. According to this perspective, a country's wealth and
prosperity are measured by valuable resources like gold, silver, and
trade volume. The rapid development of mercantilist thinking can be
attributed to the wars and competitive environment in European
countries during this period. The struggle for cheap raw materials,
labor, and markets, essentially the acquisition of colonies, was
predominant among countries like France, England, Spain, Portugal,
and the Netherlands.
Contributing to the development of mercantilist views were scholars
known as Mercantilists. They emphasized directing economic activities
to increase the country's money supply and ensure more gold and
silver enter the country. To achieve this goal, governments were
allowed to intervene in the market with customs duties to boost
exports, restrict imports, and protect certain companies contributing to
the growth of foreign trade.
Mercantilism
Although not precisely defined, this movement occurred between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Increasing a country's wealth and obtaining more gold and precious metals were dependent on foreign
trade. Therefore, to achieve a trade surplus, imports had to be reduced, or even banned, and exports
encouraged.
This era witnessed increased exploration, maritime activities, and colonization. Valuable metals flowed
from the discovered and colonized countries to Europe.
The growing trade volume led to the emergence of a powerful merchant class, and strong states imposed
restrictions on foreign trade in favor of these merchants.
The industrial sector was favored over agriculture. Capital companies were established, and limited
liability was introduced to distribute risks among shareholders.
Due to the belief that interest rates would reduce national capital, borrowing (especially from foreign
sources) was not welcomed during this period.
Population growth was encouraged since a larger population would increase the workforce, lower
production costs, and boost exports.
Despite the increase in trade volume, limited rights were granted to the working class (serfs) at the
expense of their impoverishment. This approach, focusing on expanding trade, eventually led to
widespread uprisings like the French Revolution.
Physiocracy
The emphasis of the Mercantilist system on industrial production triggered a reaction from the
agricultural sector. François Quesnay, the founder of the Physiocratic view, laid the foundation for liberal
economic thinking. Advocating the principle of "let them do, let them pass," Physiocracy defended the
existence of the natural order and opposed state intervention, claiming that economic balance would be
achieved spontaneously.
While Physiocracy was initially proposed to address France's structural problems at the time, it was
influenced by England's capitalist transformation in the agricultural sector during the same period. In
general, the characteristics of the Physiocracy movement can be summarized as follows:
It emerged in the second half of the 18th century.
According to Physiocrats, agriculture is the only productive sector, and the industrial sector is considered
not to create value on its own production costs.
The Physiocratic view was developed by Physiocrats who wrote for the magazine "Ephemerides du
Citoyen," led by Quesnay.
Physiocrats are considered the first modern school of economic thought.
They advocated reducing public spending and supporting a single tax system. Physiocrats argued that
surplus value is only generated from the land and that only land should be taxed.
They believed in the existence of a natural order and claimed that it would be disrupted by state
intervention. Physiocrats, with their anti-state intervention views and arguments about the existence of
the natural order, laid the conceptual framework for classical economics.
They emphasized free foreign trade, individual freedom, and the concept of private property.
It is worth noting that Physiocracy shares similar views with Classical Economics. Especially their ideas
about the "natural order," represented by the slogan "let them do, let them pass," laid the foundation for
the birth of Classical Economics. Thus, the inclination towards liberal thinking increased gradually, and
with Adam Smith's work "The Wealth of Nations" published in 1776, classical economic thought and
liberalism began in full swing.

Classical Economic Approach
The emergence of the Classical Economic approach can be traced back to the Scottish scholar Adam
Smith and his work "The Wealth of Nations," published in 1776. The conceptual framework of this work is
largely based on the views of Physiocrats.
Classical Economics explains its assumptions about market equilibrium by assuming the presence of
perfect competition in the economy. According to this, under the assumption that prices and wages are
perfectly flexible, the economy naturally reaches full employment equilibrium through the price
mechanism. According to classical economists, when the full employment equilibrium level is disrupted
by an external supply or demand shock, the market mechanism has internal dynamics that will restore
the full employment equilibrium. Therefore, there is no need for government intervention in the economy.
According to this view, the government is considered a necessary evil and inefficient in using resources.
Operating under the philosophy of "let them do, let them pass," the Classical approach defends market
dominance and provides limited room for government activity in areas where the private sector does not
find profitable. Therefore, the role of the government in the economy should be minimal, the public
budget should be small and balanced.
The basic assumptions and approaches of classical economic thought about markets and the economy
can be summarized as follows:
Perfect competition prevails in the economy. It is believed that there is an invisible hand that naturally
brings the market into equilibrium. The invisible hand refers to flexibility in factors such as wages, prices,
and interest rates.
Government activities are limited to areas such as defense, justice, and diplomacy (night-watchman
state). Limited intervention in education, infrastructure, and healthcare, where the private sector is not
profitable, is envisaged, and government intervention is opposed outside these areas. It is assumed that
the government disrupts the natural order and is a necessary evil that uses resources inefficiently.
They advocated for the state to remain neutral at a level that would not influence market decisions such
as production, consumption, investment, and savings.
They supported a budget where taxes and public expenditures are low and balanced. Public spending
should be financed only through taxes, and borrowing should be resorted to only in extraordinary
circumstances.
Since the economy is always at full employment, they argued that government intervention through
public spending only raises the overall price level.
The main representatives of Classical Economic thought include Adam Smith, David Ricardo, T. Robert
Malthus, Nassau W. Senior, John Stuart Mill, Jean Baptiste Say, and Jean Jacques Rousseau.
They supported the "Say's Law" or the Law of Markets, stating that "every supply creates its own
demand." In other words, they assumed that every good entering the market would generate demand
equal to its production value. In essence, every production creates an income stream equal to be later
spent.
They advocated the labor theory of value, where wages are equal to the marginal productivity of labor,
and the real value of a good equals the effort put into producing it.
A significant portion of the intellectual foundations of Classical Economic thought resembles Physiocrats.
They adopted the "let them do, let them pass" slogan used by Physiocrats, expressing a desire for a
competitive and free market without government intervention.
Emphasis was placed on the supply side of the economy, and if there were to be market intervention, they
advocated resorting to monetary policy.
Savings and investments are determined by the interest rate, with investments being highly sensitive to
interest rates.
Money is only demanded for transaction purposes. Economic units will spend their entire income shortly
because they do not want to hold more money than necessary for their needs. If the entire income is not
spent, Say's Law loses its validity.
The societal and governmental philosophy of liberal thinking is based on
individual freedoms. Therefore, individualism, rationality, and freedom are
forefronted. Society is composed of rational individuals maximizing their own
benefits.
In summary, the fundamental views of the Classical approach can be
expressed as the minimization of state activities, focusing on the state's
essential duties such as defense and justice, avoiding state intervention in the
economic sphere, maintaining neutrality, and having a small and balanced
budget.
The Classical Economists' belief in the self-adjusting nature of the economy,
based on the assumption of market flexibility, resembles the equilibrium
restoration of a pendulum. Just as a pendulum, when moved away from
equilibrium, initially swings farthest from the center, gradually decreasing its
oscillation and eventually coming to rest at the central equilibrium point.
According to Classical Economists, if market equilibrium is disrupted by an
external supply or demand shock, similar to the initial response of a
pendulum, the market initially reacts strongly. However, through flexibility in
wages, prices, and interest rates, the market naturally restores balance over
time.

The idea of systematic government intervention in the market emerged with the Great Depression of
Until then, countries operated based on the assumptions of Classical and Neo-Classical economics,
believing that markets would naturally reach equilibrium through the supply, demand, and price
mechanism, and that government intervention was unnecessary.
However, the failure of these assumptions during the 1929 crisis led to the exploration of alternative
solutions beyond Classical economics. John Maynard Keynes, with his work "The General Theory of
Employment, Interest, and Money," published in 1936, provided the remedy to overcome the crisis.
Keynes emphasized the crucial role of the government in overcoming the crisis, suggesting that the
government should intervene in the economy through fiscal policy tools such as taxes and public
spending to address the inadequacy of effective demand that caused the crisis. Thus, Keynes identified
fluctuations in total demand as the cause of economic instability.
Keynes and subsequent economists contributing to this view listed tasks for the government, including
ensuring economic stability, efficient resource allocation, correcting income and wealth distribution, and
achieving economic growth and development. Although these tasks faced interruptions in certain periods
due to global developments, they were gradually accepted and implemented by all countries over time
within the framework of the contemporary or developmental state concept.
Keynesian Approach
While Keynes advocated for an interventionist state in his works, he did not provide a comprehensive
explanation of how fiscal tools should be used. This aspect was later elucidated by fiscal theorists like
Abba Lerner and Alvin Hansen under the functional finance perspective. The basic assumptions proposed
by the Keynesian approach can be summarized as follows:
Markets may not naturally reach full employment equilibrium if left to their own devices. The more
common real-world scenario is partial employment equilibrium.
Wages and prices are inflexible (rigid), making it difficult for the market to self-adjust to equilibrium
without government intervention. The inflexibility of wages is attributed to minimum wage laws and
unions.
Demand-oriented policies are prioritized. Effective demand, fueled by purchasing power, is crucial,
consisting of both consumption and investments.
The Say's Law is rejected. Keynes argues that producers consider the quantity of consumption when
making production decisions. Hence, the impact is more on demand affecting supply rather than supply
affecting demand.
In the case of inflation, Keynes supports increasing taxes and reducing public spending. Conversely,
during economic downturns, opposite policies should be implemented. Argues that budget deficits or
surpluses can address imbalances in the economy. Running a budget deficit during a downturn can
stimulate economic recovery, while a surplus is recommended during inflationary periods.
Determines employment levels, total supply, total demand, and investments.
In investment decisions, the expected marginal return of capital alongside interest plays a role. Contrary
to the classical view, Keynes asserts that investments are not highly sensitive to interest rates if future
expectations are negative.
Keynes's model focuses on the short term, as he famously stated, "In the long run, we are all dead."
Public expenditures and taxes impact national income by the value of the multiplier. In an economy with
a high marginal consumption propensity, the effect of public expenditures and taxes on national income
is more pronounced.
Individuals determine their consumption based on their current income.
Economic actors demand money for precautionary, speculative, and transaction purposes. Keynes rejects
the classical notion that money is neutral and only demanded for transaction purposes.
The Keynesian approach acknowledges that savings and consumption are functions of disposable
income, while the classical view argues that consumption is a function of interest.
Criticizes the classical assumption that increasing the money supply will lower interest rates. Keynes
explains this criticism through the Liquidity Trap assumption, stating that after a certain point, increasing
the money supply may not reduce interest rates.
In conclusion, Keynes argues that, left to its own devices, the economy would reach equilibrium with
insufficient effective demand leading to partial employment. To remedy this imbalance, he contends that
government intervention through public spending and taxes is inevitable. The key issue lies in the
difference between total demand and total income. The unspent income generates a deficiency, causing
reduced investments and increased unemployment. Therefore, the government should compensate for
the unspent portion through public expenditures, known as the pump-priming policy, to stimulate private
consumption and investment.
However, Keynesian theories proved inadequate in overcoming the stagflation crisis of the 1970s. The
Keynesian theory asserts that simultaneous unemployment and inflation are not possible, while
stagflation, emerging during that period, presented a situation where both occurred simultaneously.
Additionally, Keynesian policies focus on demand-side solutions, while stagflation arose as a supply-side
problem.
The Marxist approach is a set of ideas based on the teachings of Karl Marx (1818-1883), aiming to establish
a system in politics, philosophy, sociology, and economics. Among other Marxist theorists are Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky, and Gramsci.
One of Marx's most significant works, "Capital," published in three volumes, critically examines capitalist
production relations in depth. Marx argues that, despite enriching countries in unprecedented ways,
capitalism harbors many elements that are detrimental to the economy and social life. According to him,
the capitalist state is far from representing common interests. Marx contends that capitalism is an
unsustainable system, containing numerous factors that lead to instability. Furthermore, he asserts that
the capitalist state and its officials exploit society to protect the rights of certain interest groups.
Another crucial topic that Marx addresses is the issue of distribution. Indeed, distribution has been a
significant concern in every economic theory. The classics express that the real value of a good is equal to
the effort expended to produce it, explaining the source of value with the labor theory of value. If the view
that the only source of value is labor is correct, Marx sees the profit earned by entrepreneurs as an unjust
deduction from the value created by labor and opposes the idea of turning labor into a commodity.
Marxist Approach
Marx argues that if labor produces more than necessary for its
needs, surplus value is generated, and this output, known as
surplus value, is seized by capitalists. In essence, the capitalist
has employed the worker conditionally to produce more than
necessary for their livelihood. The worker is paid a wage for
what is necessary for their life, and the surplus value is
confiscated. Not only does the capitalist entrepreneur possess
this surplus value, but it is also shared among the landowner
renting their land and the capitalist lending their money.
However, some critics have challenged Marx's surplus value
theory, suggesting that without the surplus value
appropriated by capital owners, capital accumulation and
new investments would not be possible. From these
criticisms, it can be inferred that surplus value is a crucial
motivating factor for entrepreneurs to invest in pursuit of
profit.

Representatives of the Monetarist school, led by Friedman, aimed to draw attention to the shortcomings
of Keynesian policies and the dangers of government intervention in the market during the golden age of
Keynesian policies. The inability of Keynesian assumptions to provide a solution to the crisis in the 1970s
shifted the focus towards Monetarist policies.
Monetarists, mainly from the Chicago School economists, focused more on the phenomenon of inflation,
considered a significant problem within economic imbalances. According to them, the fundamental
reason for the emergence of inflation or economic instability lies in the implementation of incorrect
monetary policies. Friedman, within the quantity theory, argues that an increase in the money supply
faster than the growth rate of national income will increase production in the short term and prices in the
long term. In this regard, Friedman advocates maintaining an equal increase in the money supply and the
growth rate of production in the economy, even suggesting legal regulation to ensure this.
Monetarist Approach
Monetarists oppose government intervention in the economy. According to them, the expansive fiscal
policies implemented by the government lead to a decrease in private sector investments. This effect,
known as the crowding-out effect, depends on how government spending is financed. If government
spending is financed through borrowing, an increase in the government's demand for borrowable funds
in the market will raise interest rates, leading to a reduction in private sector investments due to high
interest rates. If the government finances this spending through taxes, the taxes collected from the
private sector will reduce their disposable income, again causing a decrease in private sector
investments. Thirdly, if the government finances its public spending by printing money, the general price
level will rise as much as the increased money supply, reducing consumer demand.
While Monetarists largely embrace the Classical views on the market economy, their departure from the
Classics lies in the acknowledgment that the economy will not always be at full employment equilibrium.
This is primarily due to the presence of a natural unemployment rate in the economy for various reasons.
The fundamental assumptions of the Monetarist approach can be summarized as follows:
It is closer to Classical and Neo-Classical policies. The contribution of the invisible hand to progress is
more effective than the visible hand (government) contributing to regression.
Government intervention in the market disrupts resource and income distribution. Fiscal policies are not
effective.
Natural Unemployment Rate and Phillips Curve
Businesses (employers) perceive changes in input prices quickly because they are aware of them, but
their perception of price changes is short-term. However, it may take a long time for workers to perceive
the rise in prices and the decrease in purchasing power. Friedman explains the delayed perception of
price increases by employers and workers through the concept of "adaptive expectations." As a result of
this analysis, Friedman argues that the Phillips curve, representing an inverse relationship between
inflation and unemployment in the short term, is valid, but in the long term, this relationship loses its
validity, and the curve becomes vertical at the natural unemployment level.
According to Monetarists, although it is possible to reduce unemployment in the short term through an
expansionary monetary policy, this reduction is not permanent in the long term, and unemployment
returns to its previous natural level. Therefore, workers perceive and misunderstand the inflationary
policies implemented by the government in the short term. However, these units act rationally in the long
term and understand that the expansive policies implemented by the government to reduce
unemployment do not decrease unemployment but increase inflation.
The view based on the assumption of adaptive expectations, which suggests that economic units
systematically make errors in their inflation expectations, was later replaced by the Rational Expectations
Hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that economic units act rationally even in the short term and do not
make mistakes. Therefore, according to the Rational Expectations Hypothesis, the inverse relationship
between inflation and unemployment proposed by Phillips is not valid even in the short term.
The Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU)
As a response to Keynesian economics, which emphasizes the demand side of the economy, the SupplySide Economics approach suggests that achieving high growth rates and low inflation relies on
supporting the economy's supply side through tax cuts and incentives.
Supply-Side Economics argues that government intervention in the market disrupts relative price
structures, negatively impacting resource distribution. State interventions aimed at improving income
distribution and social welfare disrupt the competitive nature of the market, leading to efficiency losses.
Hence, Supply-Side Economists believe that stable economic growth can only be achieved through the
private sector.
One of the pioneers of Supply-Side Economics, Arthur Laffer, introduced the Laffer Curve, which remains
popular today. Analyzing the relationship between changes in tax rates and the tax revenue collected by
the government, Laffer argued that each tax has an optimal rate that maximizes revenue. Once this rate is
surpassed, increasing tax rates leads to a decrease in tax revenue. The key principles of the Supply-Side
Economics approach can be summarized as follows:
Supply-Side Economics Approach
The supply side of the economy is crucial. Providing tax cuts for producers and implementing incentives
leads to reduced inflation and high growth rates.
Instead of reducing demand, as Keynesian Theory suggests to decrease inflation, Supply-Side Economics
aims to increase production, resulting in lower prices for goods.
Key figures in the development of Supply-Side Economics include Dr. Stein, Jude Wanniski, Robert
Mundell, Michael K. Evans, Paul C. Roberts, and Arthur B. Laffer.
They oppose government intervention in the economy. High taxes and significant public spending
adversely affect economic activities.
Reducing income tax rates increases savings desires, while a cut in corporate taxes enhances investment
profitability.
An increase in income tax on wages reduces labor's willingness to work. Consequently, the labor supply
decreases.
The Laffer Curve
The Laffer Curve is based on a theory by supply-side
economist Arthur Laffer. Created in 1974, it visually
shows the relationship between tax rates and the
amount of tax revenue collected by governments.
The curve is often used to illustrate the argument that
cutting tax rates can result in increased total tax
revenue.
The Laffer Curve states that total tax revenue is most
likely not maximized when tax rates are at 100%, as this
disincentives workers from earning wages. It suggests
that taxes could be too low or too high to produce
maximum revenue and both a 0% income tax rate and a
100% income tax rate generate $0 in receipts.
The Laffer Curve was used as a basis for tax cuts in the
1980s during the Reagan Administration.
Critics argue that the Laffer curve is too simplistic and
uses a single tax rate.

If you look at the views of different economic schools, you can see that economists often have
disagreements on many issues. However, there are some areas where economists generally agree. One of
these is the theory of market failure, which argues that markets do not always work perfectly.
The foundations of the market failure theory were laid in the second half of the 19th century by utilitarian
economists John Stuart Mill (1859) and Henry Sidgwick (1885). This theory became a fundamental issue in
Neo-classical economic thought, and thus in welfare economics, with the contributions of Arthur C. Pigou
(1912, 1932) in the first half of the 20th century and Richard A. Musgrave (1958) in the second half.
However, this theory is now accepted with some modifications by various economic views, including
Keynesian thought.
According to the market failure theory, in the presence of conditions such as imperfect competition,
public goods, externalities, and incomplete information, markets cannot achieve efficiency on their own
or work effectively enough. In such cases, some goods are overproduced, some are underproduced, and
some are not produced at all. This theory tells us how the government should intervene in these markets
and through which tools when markets are not efficient or not working effectively. In this context, the
most important intervention tools of the government are legal regulations, taxes, public spending, and
monetary policies. The theory that advocates making markets efficient through government intervention
is called the "second-best theory" in welfare economics.
Why is the market failing?
The theory of market failure, which is one of the areas where neo-classical economics meets public
finance discipline, acknowledges certain roles for the government in the economy but asserts that the
primary mechanism for resource allocation is the market
Contrary to this view, economists like John Maynard Keynes, Joseph A. Schumpeter, and Hyman P.
Minsky argue that the failure of markets, especially financial markets, is largely due to their inherent
instability. Factors such as excessive borrowing, investors' 'animal spirits' guided by loose managerial
rules, and irrational psychologies contribute to the fragility and instability of markets. The solution
proposed by these economists involves increased government intervention and a larger role for the public
sector in the economy, known as 'big government' capitalism.
Richard A. Musgrave categorizes the roles of the government in combating market failures under three
main functions of public finance: resource allocation, income distribution, and economic stability.
Additionally, there is a widely accepted notion of the government's regulatory function. Now, let's take a
closer look at all these functions.
Musgrave and 3 main functions of public finance

The theory of market failure considers the resource allocation function as the most crucial role of public
finance. It refers to the government's activity of distributing productive resources, meaning it takes on the
task of production. This function arises due to the market mechanism's failure or inadequacy in providing
certain goods and services. When the market fails to efficiently allocate resources, especially in cases like
public goods, externalities, virtuous goods, natural monopolies, and incomplete markets, the resource
allocation function becomes essential. According to Joseph E. Stiglitz, situations with incomplete markets
and inadequate information should also be considered. To ensure efficiency in resource allocation, public
finance needs to intervene in distributing resources. This function has played a guiding role in defining the
limits of government intervention in the private economy. The situations warranting the resource
allocation function are as follows:
1. Public Goods
2. Externalities (External Economies)
3. Natural Monopolies
4. Deviations from Perfect Competition
5. Incomplete (Asymmetric) Information
Resource Allocation Function
In microeconomic theory, the detailed analysis of public goods was first conducted by American
economist Paul A. Samuelson in 1954. In his article titled "The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure,"
Samuelson provided the initial and most significant contribution to the formation of modern public goods
theory by defining two extreme types of goods: public goods and private goods.
In this work, Samuelson asserted that the fundamental characteristic of a public good is "non-rivalry,"
meaning individuals do not compete with each other in the consumption of the good. Despite initially
defining two extreme types of goods, Samuelson later acknowledged that many activities fall between
these extremes, suggesting that mixed (semi-public) situations could be analyzed.
Economist Richard A. Musgrave challenged Samuelson's assumption of a dichotomy between private and
public goods. Musgrave argued that due to the non-competitive nature of public goods consumption, the
condition of joint consumption should apply to everyone, regardless of whether they contribute to the
cost. According to Musgrave, in addition to Samuelson's condition, the definition of public goods should
include "non-excludability," meaning an individual cannot be excluded from using a good for technical or
political reasons.
In modern fiscal theory, the scientific definition of public goods has been shaped by the contributions of
Samuelson and Musgrave. Accordingly, a public good is a good that possesses both "non-rivalry" and
"non-excludability" characteristics.
Public Goods
Public goods have two characteristics that lead to their ineffective production in a market economy. The
market mechanism relies on excluding individuals from use through pricing. Individuals who don't pay
the price are excluded from using the goods. However, public goods, due to their characteristics, cannot
be priced and, therefore, cannot be subject to market production because their benefits cannot be
divided among individuals.
Contributions to the theory of public goods by other economists later focused mainly on examining
situations that possess only one of these two characteristics. Commonly encountered in daily life and
collectively referred to as quasi-public goods, these situations have been explored under various names
such as club goods and common-pool resources.
Quasi-public goods typically possess only one of the two fundamental characteristics of public goods.
These goods provide individual benefits while also contributing to societal welfare, placing them between
public goods and private goods. The rationale for the public sector to produce these goods lies in the
societal benefits they provide. However, if the production of quasi-public goods is left solely to the private
sector, their prices would be higher, and production quantity lower. This situation clearly indicates the
inefficiency of market influence in resource distribution.
Public Goods

Club goods are items where there's no competition in consumption, but exclusion is possible, and they
typically don't face congestion up to a certain capacity. Common-pool resources, on the other hand, are
goods where exclusion is not possible, but individuals compete for the use of the goods. These often
consist of naturally occurring items without established property rights.
Different perspectives exist regarding the definition of public goods. For instance, S. E. Stiegler suggests
that a public good should also have the feature of 'non-rejectability,' meaning the consumption of the
good cannot be refused. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Harvey S. Rosen broaden the concept of non-rivalry by
defining it as the ability of additional users to benefit from the public good at very low or zero cost.
Inge Kaul and Ronald U. Mendoza attempt to create a more comprehensive definition by combining
scientific and non-scientific characteristics of public goods. They highlight the difference between the
essential characteristics of goods and the features society de facto determines. According to their
expanded definition, public goods are items where no one can be excluded from consumption, and de
facto shared consumption is involved.
Club goods
Another important aspect regarding public goods is the issue of free-rider behavior exhibited by
individuals in the consumption of these goods. This phenomenon, examined as the 'free-rider problem' in
public economics, refers to individuals benefiting from a public good without contributing to its provision
due to the 'non-excludability' feature. If free-riding leads to the non-production or insufficient production
of a public good or results in the overuse of a common-pool resource, it is often considered an economic
problem.
To address the free-rider problem, a proposed solution is for the government to identify the public good
preferences of all individuals in society and then use its coercive power to compel everyone to contribute
to the financing of public goods. By implementing this approach, the government can eliminate the freerider issue and ensure the optimal provision of public goods.
However, the production of public goods can be carried out by both the public and private sectors. In
today's context, many public goods are produced by private companies and then purchased by the public
sector for distribution to the community. The rapid proliferation of information and communication
technologies, such as computers and the Internet, has led to the emergence of new public goods like 'free
and open-source software.' Unlike the typical scenario with public goods, these software programs are
predominantly produced and presented by individuals and companies in the private sector.
Free-rider behavior
Recently, a new concept has been introduced into the literature of public goods under the name 'global
public goods.' According to Inge Kaul, Isabelle Grunberg, and Marc A. Stern, global public goods are goods
that are largely universal for benefiting countries (more than one group of countries), people (all
individuals and population groups), and generations (both the present and future generations, at least
without limiting the development options of the future generations).
Global public goods are explained within the framework of the two fundamental characteristics of nonrivalry and non-excludability in consumption, as expressed in the theory of public goods. Initially, global
common goods that existed before the emergence of life on Earth, such as oceans, atmosphere, and the
ozone layer, were classified as global public goods. However, due to the impact of the globalization
process, global public goods are now mainly examined under titles such as the environment, health,
financial stability, information, peace, and security.
All these categories of global public goods are associated with the benefits or harms brought about by
globalization. The absence of a structure with decision-making and enforcement power at the
international level, equivalent to the national government, is a significant factor that complicates the
provision of global public goods.
Global Public Goods
Goods in which property rights, or more explicitly, legal rights over the benefits of the goods, are not
granted to any individual or group are called 'common (free) goods.' All individuals benefit from these
goods without any restriction on the utility of the goods. Because the benefits of the goods are open to
everyone, an individual cannot sell their rights. Due to this openness and lack of restriction, the common
good is at risk of damage when individuals excessively use it. This situation, justifying state intervention,
is referred to as the 'tragedy of the commons' problem in public economics literature.
Let's imagine a pasture that does not belong to any specific village, and each village brings its animals to
graze on this pasture. If there are no restrictions, each village's animals will come to the pasture and may
deplete the grass. Perhaps there won't be enough grass left for the animals that come last. This excessive
use without allowing the pasture, a natural and living resource, to renew itself will eventually render it
unusable.
In the grassland example, the common benefit of the community requires restricting the use of the
pasture. However, villagers cannot achieve this by reaching an agreement among themselves. Perhaps
making an agreement and ensuring compliance when there are only a few villages might be easy.
However, when numerous villages use a common pasture, they will not trust each other. This lack of trust
is known as the "prisoner's dilemma" in microeconomics.
Common Goods
In the pasture example, even though there's a shared benefit in limiting the use of the pasture, individual
villages (similar to the prisoners in the previous example) prefer not to trust each other and engage in
non-cooperative behavior (overuse). To mitigate the tragedy of the commons issue in such common
resources, the state needs to take on certain responsibilities. The state must regulate the distribution of
the common resource among individuals and over time. In doing so, the state should be authoritative and
able to restrict individual freedoms (such as pasture use). This kind of regulation is better than no
intervention by the state.
There are numerous examples of common resources. Water sources, hunting grounds, wildlife
conservation areas, radio and television broadcast frequencies, and oil reserves are well-known examples
of common resources. Additionally, the atmosphere, ozone layer, oceans, biodiversity are considered
global common resources. Even from a cultural perspective, literature, music, art, design, films, software,
historical sites, and artifacts are identified as common resources.
In this context, examples of state measures include restricting the number and timing of hunting in
hunting grounds, completely banning hunting in wildlife conservation areas, the state allocating radio
and television channel frequencies, and public museum services and preservation efforts for historical
sites and artifacts.
Common Goods
In a police investigation, two suspects are detained without sufficient evidence for arrest. Due to the lack
of evidence, the police place both suspects in separate cells and offer them a deal. According to the
agreement, if one suspect testifies against the other, the witness goes free, while the silent one receives a
10-year prison sentence. If both remain silent, they each get a 1-year sentence. If both testify against each
other, they both receive a 5-year sentence.
In this situation, each suspect must choose between testifying or remaining silent. They are not allowed
to know the other's decision until the end of the investigation, as they are in separate rooms without
communication. Therefore, fearing the possibility of a 10-year prison term, the player will not remain
silent but choose to testify against the other, accepting a shorter sentence of 5 years or going free. The
player aims to minimize their loss (maximize their gain) in this dilemma. The other party, under the same
conditions, will inevitably act rationally and also testify. Thus, the decisions made by the two parties,
without communicating, result in increased prison sentences rather than acting in good faith.
Classic Prisoner's Dilemma Scenario
Externalities, also known as external economies, are a specific type of market failure that leads to the
under or over-supply of goods and services compared to the social optimum. Externalities refer to the
indirect effects that an economic unit has on other economic units, either positively or negatively. If the
impact benefits the utility function of another firm or individual positively, it's a positive externality; if it
affects it negatively, it's a negative externality. Externalities negatively impact resource allocation. In
industries where negative externalities are prevalent, the production quantity will be above the average
level because firms don't cover all the costs generated by their activities. In the presence of positive
externalities, the production level will be below the optimal quantity. Due to these reasons, when
externalities exist, the effects may not be reflected in market prices, and under perfect competition,
Pareto optimality is not achieved.
Pareto Optimal: The resource distribution situation in a society where it is not possible to improve the
condition of one producer, consumer, or factor owner without worsening the situation of another. In
other words, if it's impossible to increase the well-being of one individual without reducing the well-being
of at least one other, the welfare of that society is considered optimal.
Externalities

Externalities and public goods share some similarities. In both cases, the activities of one individual or
group inevitably affect others. Moreover, the concept of free riding applies to externalities as well (For
example, each car driver wants to benefit from clean air without bearing the cost or prefers others to use
lead-free gasoline even if they continue using gasoline-powered vehicles). The key difference between
externalities and public goods is the assumption that not everyone is equally affected by externalities,
whereas everyone is assumed to be equally affected (benefited) by public goods.
Negative externalities are the most common and problematic examples of externalities in real life.
Environmental pollution caused by toxic waste dumped into nature, noise pollution caused by increased
traffic, and visual pollution are common examples of negative externalities. Fiscal theory suggests some
proposals to eliminate such negative externalities. These proposals include price regulations, quantity
regulations, subsidies, and regulations related to property rights.
Price regulations are recommendations derived from the approach developed by the famous economist
Arthur C. Pigou, suggesting that economic actors causing environmental pollution should pay a certain
amount or quantity of tax. This approach assumes that the polluting actor will be compelled to produce
at a higher price (and, consequently, at a lower level) by bearing the cost of the externality. Furthermore,
Pigouvian taxes of this kind are argued to be an important tool for achieving Pareto optimality. In this
context, it is suggested that Pigouvian taxes on the use/consumption of fossil fuels would reduce the
amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere and limit the leakage of oil and the use of toxic chemicals
released into nature.
Quantity regulations refer to the state's legal restrictions on economic actors' activities that emit negative
externalities or the quantity of such negative externalities. Following this path, as seen in examples such
as the state limiting the pollution emitted by car and energy factories, would both reduce environmental
pollution and lead companies to use technologies with minimal pollution. An application envisaged by
the Kyoto Protocol involves the creation and sale of pollution rights as a means of combating
environmental pollution. To achieve this, an acceptable pollution level is determined, and a document
indicating the maximum pollution level, which prohibits emissions above this level, is sold to polluting
companies by the relevant institution or authority for a certain fee. Thus, companies purchasing pollution
rights (permits) gain credits for polluting the environment. The companies that purchase these permits
can sell their rights to others or exchange them for other pollution rights.
Subsidy applications typically aim to encourage the use of clean technologies or provide facilities to
companies for not spreading pollution to the environment. In a situation where the number of producers
is fixed, subsidies have a deterrent effect, similar to taxes. However, subsidies also have a cost, and this
cost is covered by tax revenues. The most common countries implementing this practice are European
Union countries. In Europe, many countries apply tax and subsidy programs for environmental
technology investments and research and development expenses. Additionally, many funds of the Union
are specifically allocated for subsidies to support weaker countries in the Union.
Regulations related to property rights in public economics involve some adjustments within the
framework of the Coase theorem. Developed by Nobel laureate economist Ronald H. Coase in 1960,
according to this theorem, if property rights are established in externalities and the condition of zero
transaction costs is met, one party can compensate for the other's loss, reaching social optimum, and
achieving economic efficiency. The economic efficiency is not affected by which party is given property
rights, but it does impact the distribution of benefits between the parties.
While negative externalities are often associated with externalities, there are cases where many private
goods create positive externalities. The most well-known examples of these positive externalities are
vaccination activities, education, and health protection activities. These activities positively affect the
well-being of individual people as well as improving overall societal well-being. However, the market
tends to produce these types of activities insufficiently. Such activities need to be supported or produced
through state intervention. Today, it is possible to further expand activities that create positive
externalities. For example, the implementation of the mortgage finance system can also be considered a
positive externality. States considering the positive social aspect of homeownership may allow the
deduction of interest paid on such home loans from taxes. Similarly, we can say that the Internet has
become highly important today as a technology that largely generates positive externalities.
Coined by Richard A. Musgrave, this term refers to goods that, despite being socially necessary and
beneficial, have insufficient demand due to inadequate knowledge (education) and income levels.
Therefore, the government encourages or compels individuals to consume such goods.
Typical examples of virtuous goods include vaccines, milk, and compulsory education. Hence, the
government promotes the consumption of these goods by implementing activities such as mandatory
vaccinations, free milk distribution in schools, and compulsory education. Additionally, subsidies and
facilities are provided to private companies producing these goods to encourage the society to consume
them more affordably and consequently in larger quantities.
In today's world, there are numerous examples of these goods. When viewed broadly, assistance to the
poor, student scholarships, dormitories, and nursing homes are also considered virtuous goods. In fact,
there is no specific reason why items like fish, newspapers, and the Internet should not be regarded as
virtuous goods.
On the opposite side of the spectrum are goods known as vicious goods. Vicious goods are those that,
despite being socially harmful, are widely consumed when there is no government intervention. Legal
products like cigarettes and alcohol fall into this category, as well as completely illegal substances like
various drugs. While taxes are often used to reduce the consumption of items like cigarettes and alcohol,
the government employs coercive measures (laws and police force) to prevent the production and
consumption of illegal substances.
Virtuous Goods
Another reason for the failure of a competitive market economy is the presence of markets with
increasing returns to scale at high production levels. In these markets, due to the high scale and initial
investments, each additional unit of production consistently lowers long-term average costs. Therefore,
in such industries, only one private company can survive. The company that can increase its production
more than its competitors lowers its costs and eliminates the others.
Examples of industries where companies naturally tend to monopolize production areas include
telecommunications services, natural gas distribution, electricity distribution, water and sewerage
networks, and railway operations.
In cases of natural monopoly, the government can take various measures. Firstly, it may choose to do
nothing. If a natural monopoly is making efforts for innovation through intensive R&D, social benefits may
arise. Secondly, the government may want to determine the monopoly's price. However, deciding where
to set the price poses a separate challenge. If the price is set at marginal cost, the monopoly will incur
losses, but resource allocation efficiency will be achieved. If the price is set at average cost, the monopoly
will not incur losses, but there will be an efficiency loss. The third measure is for the public sector to take
over production as a public economic entity. In this case, the public sector will determine the price of the
monopoly based on societal welfare, not profitability. If marginal cost pricing is used in this production,
the resulting loss will need to be financed with tax revenues. These three measures vary from country to
country and depend on the structures of the industries.
Natural Monopolies
One reason for inefficiency in resource allocation is the existence of incomplete or missing markets. For an
economy to function efficiently, it is argued that there should be a market for every good. The failure of
private markets to deliver a good or service is a clear market failure. Examples of this are:
• Insurance:
There is market failure in the field of insurance due to the unpredictability, excess, and variety of future
risks. Reverse selection and moral hazard are significant failure elements. Reverse selection arises when
insured individuals with different probabilities of risk occurrence exist. Some of these insured individuals
may be high-risk, while others may be low-risk (for example, in car insurance, where it is not known if one
driver is more careful than another). Moral hazard refers to situations that cannot be controlled by the
insurer, affecting the likelihood and magnitude of the loss by the insured (for example, when insured
individuals are negligent in taking accident-preventing measures or individuals with health risks
obtaining health insurance). These two situations, also known as the problem of asymmetric information,
are assumed to prevent the formation of perfectly competitive future markets. In this case, the
government often intervenes in areas such as unemployment insurance, health insurance, and social
security.
Incomplete Markets
• Capital and Credit:
Despite the existence of capital markets and financial institutions, the provision of capital and credit is
among the types of market failures. Examples include loans provided to university students, loans for
farmers, small businesses (SMEs), and mortgages, where the government creates a credit mechanism and
intervenes in the market.
• Complementary Markets:
Another significant area where incomplete markets exist is the financing of large and complex projects. In
this context, certain markets are complementary and require coordination. In these markets, each
(private) producer should not operate alone but rather function collectively and diversely. Large-scale
national investment and infrastructure projects are carried out in such markets."
Incomplete Markets
One of the assumptions of the neoclassical model regarding perfect competitive markets is that buyers
and sellers have complete information about the market. Complete information, in its broadest form,
means having full knowledge about the present and future. However, the assumption that producers and
consumers have complete information is often not entirely accurate. More often than not, producers have
more extensive and comprehensive information about the goods or services involved in economic activity
compared to consumers. The difference in information about the characteristics of the good between
buyers and sellers provides the seller with market power, leading to market failure. In this process, a
consumer without sufficient information cannot accurately assess the value of the good, and therefore,
an exchange that would benefit both parties does not take place.
Efforts to address information failures through consumer organizations, civil society organizations, and
certain legal regulations have some mitigating effects on market failures, but they are not entirely
successful. Therefore, in markets where information failure exists, it is necessary for the government to
establish standards to protect consumers against low-quality goods, make producers obligated to inform
consumers about the characteristics and potential risks of goods and services, or support the formation of
independent information markets to educate consumers.
In such cases, government intervention can help increase the flow of information, contributing to the
elimination of uncertainty in the market.
Information Failures
Those opposing legal regulations on information disclosure argue that it is unnecessary, as competitive
markets would incentivize firms to disclose relevant information. Additionally, they claim that consumers
are not very sensitive to the information forced to be disclosed by laws, and both implementing
governments and obligated firms consider it a cost. On the other hand, supporters of regulations argue
that, despite implementation challenges, they are beneficial. Moreover, the state's quest to address
information deficiencies goes beyond a simple consumer protection measure. In many aspects,
information can be considered a public good. Providing more information to one individual does not
reduce the amount available to others. For efficiency, information should either be provided for free or
the cost should be limited to the cost of transmitting the information. Private markets, like other public
goods, often inadequately provide information.


According to Musgrave, another significant function of the public sector is income distribution. However,
fulfilling the income distribution function is more challenging for the public sector than performing the
resource allocation function. According to neoclassical economic theory, the initial inequality in income
and wealth distribution is attributed to differences in individual abilities and wealth acquired through
inheritance. Even if these factors were initially distributed fairly, over time, variations in individual
abilities and the differences in the prices of these abilities, along with variations in education received,
lead to further deterioration of income distribution. Competitive markets inherently work in a way that
disrupts income distribution.
Income distribution is considered a crucial factor determining the welfare of a society. In an environment
where income distribution is unfair, individuals, due to inadequate purchasing power, will demand fewer
goods and services. As a result, markets will produce luxury consumption goods for those with sufficient
income, while fundamental goods and services that enhance the welfare of the majority of society will not
be produced. Ultimately, this situation can lead to further deterioration of income distribution, an
increase in poverty, and even social and political instability accompanied by various quests for justice.
Income distribution
All these reasons make it necessary for the state to intervene in the economy to correct income
distribution. The public sector implements these interventions in three ways. Firstly, it directly intervenes
in factor markets through direct regulations, such as setting minimum wage regulations and quotas for
employment of disabled individuals, women, etc. Secondly, it achieves the redistribution of physical and
human capital through tax policies (e.g., wealth taxes) and public spending policies (e.g., education and
health expenditures) and public economic enterprises. Thirdly, it directly intervenes in income
distribution by using taxes (e.g., progressive income taxes) and social transfers, financing virtuous goods
from the state budget. As Claude Jessua pointed out, governments need to delicately mediate between
their pursuit of economic efficiency and their concern for social justice through their income distribution
function.

Musgrave's third major economic function attributed to public finance is the economic stability function.
Although economic stability is often seen as a topic within macroeconomics, its function in public finance
continues to be examined. This function encompasses macroeconomic issues such as inflation, deflation,
unemployment in labor markets, and trade imbalances resulting from supply-demand imbalances in
goods and services markets. The essence of the economic stability function lies in attempting to balance
markets using both fiscal and monetary policies and resolving the specified macroeconomic problems
within the public sector.
Governments have also recognized the responsibility of creating conditions for long-term growth and
development within the scope of the economic stability function. Like many developing countries,
governments have engaged in long-term planning and coordination efforts for growth and development.
However, the increasing openness of economies in the 1980s and the subsequent rapid globalization
period led governments to emphasize monetary policy in their conjunctural policies. Particularly, to
combat various types of inflation, they delegated the task of maintaining price stability to central banks.
Open economy practices and the phenomenon of globalization have caused this function to take a back
seat compared to its previous roles.

The regulatory function closely resembles the resource allocation function. The government's efforts to
regulate decisions of producers and consumers, reducing monopolistic elements and externalities, are an
example of this. However, in some cases, it is necessary for the government to regulate the behavior of
producers to protect consumers. Regulations restrict individuals' quality and freedom by establishing
rules, and these regulations imply the enforcement of rules by an administratively supported institution
backed by law.
Why is regulation necessary? According to Joseph A. Schumpeter, the capitalist system produces a social
order that most of us find hostile and want to regulate. Regulations exist to protect public interests from
the inefficiencies of certain market outputs inherent in unregulated free-market capitalism, such as its
irrationality and selfishness. Some economists liken regulations to replacing the invisible hand with the
invisible fist.
The controls and restrictions within the scope of this function of the state are designed to protect the
interests of certain groups in society and enhance their well-being. Therefore, the state intervenes in and
regulates the resource allocation process of the market. For example, by enacting laws against
monopolies, controlling stock market transactions, protecting consumers from fraud, preventing harm to
consumer health, and regulating working conditions, the state fulfills its regulatory function. The state
also regulates the money supply, prices of public services and nationalized industries, and various
resource allocation decisions in the economy through pricing and income policies.

The overall economy consists of both the public and private sectors. It's crucial to distribute limited
resources efficiently and meet needs effectively in the national economy. This requires cooperation and
division of labor between the public and private sectors. Over time, the division of tasks and the shares of
these sectors in the economy may vary. Due to the changing responsibilities of the public sector, it's
challenging to define its boundaries consistently.
From the emergence of the need for government until today, there have been various debates about what
kind of tasks the government should take on and what its limits should be. Differences in the size of the
public economy within the overall economy stem from many reasons. The concept of the state changes
over time, adapting to historical and social conditions. Changes in the understanding of the state,
influenced by economic and political structures as well as social characteristics, lead to fluctuations in the
scope of the public sector, either contracting or expanding. Depending on the adopted concept of the
state, the public sector economy can have a significant share in the total economy or shrink due to
reduced government responsibilities. For example, during periods of liberal policies, government tasks
and responsibilities are minimized, while during protectionist periods, these boundaries may expand.
Especially in recent years, neo-liberal economic policies have played a decisive role in determining what
the government should or should not do.
Public and private sector relations?
Consequently, discussions have arisen about the withdrawal of the state from economic activities,
privatization, and advocating for a small but efficient government structure, aiming to reduce the share of
the public sector in the overall economy. Since the 1980s, significant debates about the role and function
of the state have emerged, particularly in Western countries. In liberal economic thought, an expansion of
the public sector implies increased budget deficits. Additionally, there are arguments suggesting that
managing the government like a business is the key to efficiently using resources. This new
understanding, developed conceptually, has been practically implemented in many countries.
New phenomena, factors, and thoughts emerging in the economic, political, administrative, and social
realms have been decisive in reshaping the public sector. Depending on economic, social, and political
structures, the share of the public sector in national economies has varied over time. Economic crises and
technological advancements, among other factors, have significantly influenced the perception of the
state. Public finance plays a crucial role in directing the use and distribution of resources in the overall
economic life. Changes in the shares of public and private economies in an economy have multiple
effects, influencing the determination of general economic policies and the resolution of economic issues.
The quality and impact of public interventions on societal welfare are vital because the quality and
effectiveness of public services directly affect societal welfare. These changes also affect the
organizational aspect of the state and the processes involved in determining and implementing public
policies.
The relationship between the public and private sectors is crucial for the overall economy. We can define
key aspects of this relationship using Figure 1, which illustrates the circulation of income, expenditure,
goods, and services in the economy. The public sector, represented by the government, provides public
goods and services. Households and firms pay taxes in exchange for these goods and services. Then, the
government uses these taxes, along with inputs from private goods and services, to sustain the
production of public goods and services. During this process, components of the public sector utilize
intermediate inputs and outputs from other public sector components.
In a mixed economy, the size of the public sector is measured by the level of public expenditures that have
significant effects on the economy. Expenses for purchasing goods and services and using production
factors account for a significant portion of these expenditures. Moreover, changes in the total amount and
composition of public expenditures are crucial factors for macroeconomic stability and growth. According
to one viewpoint, the public sector itself ensures the profitability and stability of the private sector.
Keeping the public sector large enough to mitigate the severity of economic contractions by allowing
budget deficits when necessary can stabilize the economy. However, another perspective suggests that
excessive growth in public expenditures, leading to a bloated public sector, could result in inflationary
consequences and hinder economic growth by crowding out private investments. Similarly, the method
of financing government expenditures also yields significant economic consequences. The types and rates
of taxes used in this financing affect individuals' welfare and decisions regarding the allocation of
resources in the private sector. While a tax system can support efficiency and equity, it can also have
adverse effects in these areas.

In Turkey, particularly after the 1980s, there has been a shift towards a tax system with a prevalence of
indirect taxes to enhance efficiency, albeit at the expense of equity. If there is a deficit or surplus in the
budget, it affects the balance between government savings and investments or the balance of payments
(the balance between exports and imports). The size and financing method of this deficit are crucial for
macroeconomic stability. If there is a budget deficit, it is financed through government borrowing in
financial markets. Conversely, if there is a budget surplus, the government will aim to increase savings in
the economy. The public sector can both influence and be influenced by the economy's performance. For
example, during an economic crisis, public revenues may decrease or remain unchanged, leading to
reduced provision of public services, especially if there are relatively high levels of debt and budget
deficits. Additionally, the government must bear the consequences if its decisions have adverse effects on
the economy. One typical example is how high budget deficits lead to higher interest rates, increasing the
government's interest expenses. In Turkey, during the economic crises of 1994 and 2000-2001, the
provision of public services decreased, and the government incurred increasing levels of interest burden
to cover high budget deficits. This persistence of large budget deficits after these crises has been seen as a
significant reason for their continuation.

The size of the public sector is typically measured by considering either public expenditures or public
revenues. Generally, it's calculated by comparing the expenses of institutions representing the public
sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This ratio shows the size of the public sector in an economy.
Additionally, judgments about the size of the public sector can be made using macroeconomic indicators
such as public sector employment, investments, government borrowing requirements, and debt stock.
The reason for using proportional measures is because variables related to the size of the public sector
may have different nominal and real values. While nominal measures reflect the monetary amounts of
public expenditures or revenues, using nominal measures for year-on-year comparisons can be
misleading, especially during inflationary periods. Hence, it's essential to adjust for inflation to obtain real
measures. This adjustment is typically done using a price index (usually CPI or PPI). However, even if
public revenues and expenditures increase in real terms, it may not necessarily mean that the public
sector has grown. This is because these increases may be proportional to the overall output of the
economy. Therefore, to accurately measure the size of the public sector, values related to it should be
compared to the size of the economy using proportional measures. The size of the public sector varies
depending on the measure or method used.
Measuring the Size of the Public Sector
The ratio of public expenditures to GDP is the most commonly used measure for comparing the size of the
public sector across countries. This measure considers the total of real expenditures and transfer
payments within the government budget. The reason for the popularity of this measure is that
governments typically prioritize determining public expenditures when preparing their budgets.
Governments first decide on the activities they need to undertake and then seek resources based on those
identified needs. While public expenditures are primarily covered by taxes, in cases where tax revenues
are insufficient, the government may resort to borrowing to finance its needs. Therefore, the size of public
expenditures is one of the primary indicators for illustrating the scope of the public sector.
Table 3.1 shows the ratio of public expenditures to GDP for selected countries between 2006 and 2017.
Looking at the selected countries based on 2017 data, France (%56) and Norway (%49) have the highest
ratios, while Mexico (%26) and Ireland (%26) have the lowest shares. Among these years, the most
notable country in the table is China. In China, this ratio increased from 18% in 2006 to 32% in 2017.
However, it's important to consider China's unique characteristics when interpreting this data.
Public Expenditure and Revenue as a Percentage of GDP
Table 3.1 Ratio of General Government Expenditures to GDP in Selected Countries (%)
The size of the public sector can also be measured by the size of public revenues. Initially, one might think
that public expenditures in a country would be limited to public revenues, so the ratio of public
expenditures to GDP would be the same as the ratio of public revenues to GDP. However, when the public
sector makes expenditures for its needs, it doesn't only finance these expenditures through taxes but also
through other sources like borrowing. It's important to consider which revenues count as public revenues
when using this measure. If one wants to measure the public sector's position in the overall economy,
then all revenues obtained by the state, whether obtained coercively or voluntarily, should be taken into
account. Table 3.2 shows the ratio of public revenues to GDP for selected countries between 2006 and
1.    Looking at the selected countries for 2017, it's observed that India has the lowest ratio, while France
and Norway have the highest. In Turkey, this ratio decreased from 34% in 2006 to 31% in 2017. When
evaluating the period from 2006 to 2017 overall, the largest increase in this ratio occurred in China, while
the largest decrease occurred in Ireland.
Table 3.2 Ratio of General Government Revenues to GDP in Selected Countries (%)
:
Another measure used to gauge the size of the public sector is the ratio of the public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) to GDP. PSBR indicates the difference between total income and expenditure of all
units within the public sector, used to calculate the total borrowing needs of the public sector. PSBR was
introduced to address the negative consequences of traditional deficits and to facilitate more meaningful
comparisons between countries. This ratio represents the measurement of traditional deficits in cash
terms. Additionally, it's significant for understanding the effects of general public activities on nonresidents and the national economy. Table 3.3 displays the PSBR for selected countries between 2006 and
1.    Looking at the table, the overall trend in countries' PSBR ratios has deteriorated, indicating that
public expenditures have grown more than public revenues in these countries. For instance, the countries
with the highest deterioration rates during this period are China, Spain, and Turkey, respectively.
Conversely, the countries where the PSBR ratio improved are Germany and Greece. However, it's crucial
to evaluate this ratio considering each country's unique economic characteristics and events during this
period. For example, following the 2008 crisis, Greece's PSBR rose to around -15%. Subsequently, through
significant austerity measures, this ratio was reduced to 0% by 2017.
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and the Ratio of
Public Debt Stock to GDP

The Ratio of Public Sector Employment to Total Employment
Understanding the proportion of public sector employment within total employment in a country can give
us an idea about the size of the public sector. In many countries, public sector employment accounts for
around a quarter of total employment. Figure 3.2 illustrates the rates of public sector employment in
Turkey between 2007 and 2014. The right axis shows the proportion of public sector employment within
total employment, while the left axis indicates the number of public sector employees. Looking at both
data points, there seems to be an increase in the number of employees, but a decrease in the
employment rate. This suggests that public sector employment isn't growing as fast as private sector
employment.
Public Sector Employment (Million People)
Ratio of Public Sector Employment to Total Employment (%)
The Ratio of Public Sector Investments to Total Investments
Analyzing the proportion of public sector investments within total investments provides another indicator
of the size of the public sector. If the share of public sector investments in total investments is increasing,
it suggests an expansion of the public sector. However, this increase may not always directly reflect the
growth of the public sector. Looking at the investments made by the government can reveal its size within
the economy and how much resources it utilizes. Additionally, it helps determine whether the economy is
more public or private sector-oriented. Figure 3.3 illustrates the share of public sector investments in total
investments and GDP in Turkey between 1998 and 2016.

The government's tasks and guidance are primarily carried out by the public sector within public finance.
The state fulfills its financial, social, and economic responsibilities through various institutions. Managing
public finance closely relates to legal regulations, techniques, and organizational structures. The public
sector can be understood narrowly or broadly. Narrowly, it includes central government institutions;
broadly, it encompasses central and local government bodies, quasi-governmental organizations, and
public enterprises. Like many countries, Turkey also has a multifaceted public sector. With the enactment
of Law No. 5018 on Public Financial Management and Control in 2006, the structure of the public sector in
Turkey was significantly redesigned. Accordingly, the Turkish public sector consists of general
government institutions and public economic enterprises (PEEs). Within general government institutions,
the emphasis is on central government institutions comprising general-budget institutions, specialbudget institutions, and regulatory and supervisory institutions. Other components of general
government institutions include social security institutions and local governments. It should be noted
that revolving funds and funds outside this Law are essentially components of the public sector.
SCOPE OF PUBLIC SECTOR IN TURKEY

The institutions grouped under central government institutions in Law No. 5018 are general-budget
institutions, special-budget institutions, regulatory, and supervisory institutions. Central government
institutions are the most significant in terms of income, expenditure, and impact within the public sector.
General-budget institutions, listed in Appendix (1) of Law No. 5018, are state institutions that produce
fully or partially public goods and are financed by the state budget. These institutions, included in the
state legal entity, do not generate revenue for the services they provide. They operate as public service
providers, funded by the revenues shown in Table "B" of the general budget, covering all their expenses.
These institutions strictly adhere to classic budget principles, especially the allocation principle, and do
not have their own specific revenues. According to budget principles, budget allocations must be used in
accordance with the purposes defined by laws and within the amounts specified in the laws. When the
legislative body approves budget expenditures, it does so not in bulk but section by section and item by
item. Accordingly, general-budget institutions cannot spend allocated funds for purposes other than
those specified in the budget. The funds allocated to these institutions in the budget can only be used for
the specified year, in the specified amount, and for the specified purposes. When looking at the budget of
these institutions, only allocations for expenditures are seen. These institutions benefit from the portion
of public revenues allocated to them in the budget. In Turkey, general-budget institutions consist of the
Presidency, high courts, ministries, and the Board of Judges and Prosecutors.
Central Government Institutions
Special-budget institutions are public administrations listed in Appendix (II) of Law No. 5018, established
under a ministry or related to perform specific public services. They are allocated revenue, authorized to
spend from these revenues, and regulated by special laws regarding their establishment and operation
principles. These institutions operate in various service areas and generally produce semi-public goods
and services on behalf of the state. To be classified as special-budget, an institution must be allocated
specific revenues, have the authority to spend from those revenues, and be granted executive authority
with a special budget by law. They have separate legal entities and cash units managing their accounts.
The rules specified in their special laws govern the accounts and transactions of special-budget
institutions, allowing them flexibility beyond the strict rules of the general budget when necessary for
economic activities. Since these institutions can generate income, their expenditures are covered by their
own revenues. They have their own budgets to manage their income and expenses, prepared alongside
the general budget. Each special-budget institution has a separate budget law that includes revenue and
expenditure estimates. General budget law provisions apply to implementation issues. If the revenues of
special-budget institutions do not cover their expenses, funds are transferred from the general budget to
the special budgets as treasury aid. Conversely, if their revenues exceed expenses, the surplus income is
transferred to the general budget. In our country, special-budget institutions are classified as Higher
Education institutions and other special-budget institutions. Universities are higher education institutions
with scientific autonomy and public legal personality, providing high-level education, scientific research,
publishing, and consulting services. To ensure their financial autonomy, these institutions are organized
as special-budget organizations in our country.

In university budgets, various income sources are included, such as state contributions, treasury aid,
student fees, tuition fees, sales of printed or visual teaching materials, book and publication sales,
movable and immovable property income, transfers from revolving capital enterprises, donations, grants,
and other revenues. Another type of institution within the scope of central administration is regulatory
and supervisory institutions. These institutions, established by special laws as agencies, institutions, or
boards, are listed in the annex (III) of Law No. 5018.
The idea that the state should assume a regulatory and supervisory role in areas handed over to the
private sector for the public good has emerged during this process. In this context, any regulation made
by the government to achieve its economic and social objectives is referred to as regulation. Regulatory
and supervisory institutions are also established for these purposes.
These institutions, composed of a decision-making body consisting of a specific number of individuals,
primarily tasked with regulation and supervision in a specific area as authorized by law, enjoy financial
and administrative autonomy. They exercise their powers independently within their own responsibility
and are accountable within the framework of the principles specified in their laws. With their special
statuses defined by law, these public entities can benefit from state resources but are subject to
legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. They are authorized to regulate and supervise sectors
autonomously based on their specific mandates.
Communication, energy, economic competition, telecommunications, banking, and finance sectors are
considered sensitive due to their crucial role in social life, high susceptibility to technological
advancements, and relevance to fundamental rights and freedoms. The need to shield these sectors from
the influence and pressure of politicians and actors operating within these sectors is a primary reason for
the emergence of regulatory institutions.
In Turkey, regulatory and supervisory institutions primarily serve in these areas, as outlined in Law No.
1.    While subject to a limited number of articles specified in the law, these institutions are generally
exempt from its scope, without any provisions that would compromise their financial autonomy.
Regulatory institutions have the authority to conduct inspections and impose sanctions. They operate
with their own legal entities, separate budgets, and independent revenue streams, managing their
accounts and cash transactions themselves. At the end of the financial year, regulatory institutions
transfer any surplus income to the general budget. The list of regulatory and supervisory institutions in
Turkey is provided in Annex 4.
Social security programs are essentially government spending programs designed to provide income to
individuals in anticipation of potential economic and social risks they may encounter in their lives. These
risks include poverty, unemployment, economic uncertainty about the future, old age, and illness. The
uncertainties and risks inherent in life have led people in society to seek mechanisms that will make them
feel secure. Social security institutions are organizations that are part of social security programs, aiming
to alleviate or eliminate the negative consequences of social hazards such as poverty, unemployment,
economic uncertainty, old age, and illness by taking necessary measures to provide income.
The rationale for establishing a social security system as a public service in a country is that the high cost
of obtaining information in this field leads to market failure. On the other hand, individuals' access to
social security creates some positive externalities, such as reducing population growth rates, decreasing
crime rates, and reducing poverty and income inequality.
İŞKUR, generally aims to facilitate job finding and employment, actively participates in various stages of
the labor market, takes measures to prevent unemployment, engages in various initiatives to develop,
protect, and expand employment, and administers Unemployment Insurance services. The institution's
purpose is to identify market needs through an effective labor market information system, match labor
supply and demand accordingly, facilitate employment through labor programs, enhance and protect
employment, develop vocational skills, provide temporary income support to those who lose their jobs,
and develop and implement employment measures through social dialogue.
Social Security Institutions
Like in many countries worldwide, Turkey's existing social security system faces complex and significant
challenges, primarily demographic, financial, managerial, and political issues. The fundamental financial
problem of the social security system in Turkey lies in the inadequacy of its revenues compared to its
expenditures and managerial problems related to revenue-expenditure management. When the revenues
of the social security system are insufficient, transfers are made from the treasury to these institutions
annually. On one hand, the existence of informal economy negatively impacts the social security system
by excluding certain workers, while on the other hand, the conditions for benefiting from the system's
rights and services are eased for different political reasons, increasing the system's expenditures and thus
creating additional financing needs.
Some of the key problems that can create financial issues in the social security system include frequent
changes in the retirement age for political gains, relatively low retirement age, issues with premium
collection, amnesty practices for premiums, early retirement, rapid aging leading to an increase in elderly
dependency ratio, low determination of premiums, informal employment, lack of consistent state policies
regarding the social security system, increase in the number of retirees, utilization of collected premium
revenues for political purposes, funding non-contributory payments from institutional resources, and
institutional and managerial problems.
Redirecting resources to productive areas and investments that promote employment growth and
address regional imbalances will also be facilitated by the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
Local governments are established to provide services on matters most relevant to individuals living in a
specific geographical area due to their coexistence. They are legal entities formed by elected
representatives of voters, with their establishment principles specified by law, to meet the local common
needs of province, municipality, or village residents. In summary, local government units are established
to perform public services at the local level, having their own legal personality, budgets, and decisionmaking bodies. Local governments fulfill the tasks and powers transferred to them by the central
administration within a certain framework, referred to as local autonomy. Autonomy, in essence, is the
right and authority of an individual or institution to make legally valid decisions and implement them
independently. However, the central administration also holds administrative supervision authority over
local governments to ensure that local services are conducted in accordance with the principle of the
integrity of administration, to achieve unity in public duties, to protect societal interests, and to meet
local needs adequately, as per the principles and procedures specified in the law. Administrative
supervision is a limited control authority exercised by the central administration over the actions and
transactions of local government organizations, based on the law. The purpose of administrative
supervision is to protect the general interests of the state, ensure the unity and coherence of public
services, and also to safeguard against arbitrary practices of local authorities. In Turkey, local
governments are listed in the Constitution as provincial special administrations, municipalities, and
villages.
Local Governments
Revolving fund enterprises, a component of the public sector, emerged to utilize idle capacity during the
execution of essential and continuous public services and duties by the state. Revolving Fund refers to the
capital allocated to enterprises established by the public administration to sustain activities related to the
production of goods and services that cannot be effectively managed according to general administrative
principles, arising from the essential and continuous public duties specified by laws.
According to the definition, revolving funds primarily:
Arise when general and special budget administrations perform essential and continuous public services.
Are allocated for activities of a commercial, industrial, agricultural, cultural, or professional nature that
cannot be managed according to general administrative principles.
Key features of revolving fund enterprises include:
Having their specific laws. Obligation to fulfill essential public duties and utilize excess capacity. Ability to
be established not only by general budget administrations but also by special budget administrations.
Possession of budgetary autonomy. Lack of legal personality.
Revolving Fund Enterprises
Revolving fund enterprises aims to:
• Provide commercial and industrial services alongside essential public services.
• Utilize idle capacity resulting from the use of public resources.
• Partially meet societal demand.
• Generate additional revenue for the state.
• Desire for more freedom in resource generation by moving away from strict budget control and
oversight.
The mentioned objectives of revolving fund enterprises can also be considered as their positive
contributions to the state. However, there are also negative aspects, such as:
• Contradiction with budget unity and non-allocation principles.
• Disruption of the public personnel salary regime through additional payments from revolving fund
revenues.
• Unethical practices like falsely showing some personnel as working in revolving fund enterprises to
collect contribution fees.
• Indiscrimination in spending due to the undefined boundaries of activities under the responsible
administration, resulting in waste of resources.
• Lack of modern management practices.
Public economic enterprises are a part of the public sector. According to the European Centre of
Enterprises with Public Participation (CEEP), a public economic enterprise (PEE) is defined as "enterprises
established to produce goods and services, with more than half of their financial resources provided by
central or local public administrations, or with their operational results being the responsibility of and
supervised by these administrations."
The concept of public economic enterprises generally refers to state organizations operating in the
economic field using public resources, with the common goal being the "public interest." Among the
objectives of PEEs are:
• Facilitating economic development
• Operating monopolies under state control
• Undertaking tasks in areas where the private sector has failed or not entered
• Influencing the economy
• Increasing employment and production
• Supporting and leading the private sector
• Regulating income distribution
Public Economic Enterprises (PEEs)
The objectives of PEEs also serve as their defining characteristics. Additionally, common features of PEEs
include having legal personality, being subject to private law, having limited liability proportional to their
capital, and not aiming for profit. Essentially, PEEs are non-profit organizations. Therefore, they are
criticized for being ineffective and costly due to factors such as political pressure and interference,
politically determined locations and managers, management inadequacies, low productivity, frequent
price interventions, inefficient resource utilization, unnecessary hiring, high base price practices,
outdated technology, frequent turnover of top executives, hindering the competitiveness of the private
sector, and causing unfair competition.
In Turkey, when we assess the establishment process of Public Economic Enterprises (PEEs), especially in
the early years of the republic, it's evident that supporting the private sector was a prominent idea. The
Izmir Economic Congress held in 1923 highlighted the importance of an active private sector in the market
for development, with the state supporting and incentivizing it. However, due to the effects of the Great
Depression of 1929, which affected the whole world including Turkey, the private sector couldn't make
the expected progress. The establishment of Sümerbank in 1933 as the first PEE in Turkey marked the
direct entry of the state into the economic sphere. In Turkey, PEEs were divided into Economic State
Enterprises (ESEs) and Public Economic Organizations (PEOs) by Decree Law No. 233 issued in 1984,
which is still in effect. Public Economic Enterprise (PEE) is the common name for both Economic State
Enterprises and Public Economic Organizations.
• Economic State Enterprise (ESE) is a public economic enterprise where the entire capital belongs to
the state, established to operate in the economic field according to commercial principles.
• Public Economic Organization (PEO) is a public economic enterprise where the entire capital belongs
to the state, established to produce and market goods and services of monopolistic nature in the
public interest, and the goods and services it produces are considered privileged due to the public
service it provides.
Additionally, in Decree Law No. 233, the concepts of institution, subsidiary partnership, participation, and
operation are also defined:
• Institution: It is a group of enterprises or operations affiliated with an Economic State Enterprise or a
Public Economic Organization, where all capital belongs to them.
• Subsidiary Partnership: These are joint-stock companies consisting of enterprises or a group of
enterprises where more than fifty percent of the capital belongs to an Economic State Enterprise or a
Public Economic Organization.
• Participation: These are joint-stock companies where Economic State Enterprises, Public Economic
Organizations, or subsidiary partnerships own at least fifteen percent and at most fifty percent of the
capital.
• Operation: These are factories and other units that produce goods and services for institutions and
subsidiary partnerships.
Funds in Turkey, a component of the public sector, are money set aside for a specific purpose, collected
and spent when needed. They can be classified as social, cultural, and economic funds based on their
purposes. The fundamental classification of funds is into budgetary and extra-budgetary funds.
Budgetary funds mainly derive their monetary source from budget allocations and have specific features
for their usage. They are generally managed by the Ministry of Finance. Extra-budgetary funds, on the
other hand, are established by special laws, operate independently of budget principles and laws, and
manage their own revenues and expenditures. Various reasons are cited for resorting to fund practices in
the public sector, such as escaping existing financial regulations and controls, generating additional
public income, and allocating them to specific expenses to implement decisions quickly. However, as
witnessed in the 1990s, fund practices over time pose risks of confusion and uncertainty in the public
financial system. They may lead to a lack of adherence to budgetary principles, the elimination of cash
management in public spending, and perhaps most importantly, distancing governments from legislative
oversight. Additionally, prioritization of certain goods and services over others funded by public resources
becomes a concern. In Turkey, the majority of fund practices, numbering around 75 at the beginning of
2000, were closed with the financial system regulations made in 2000 and 2001. Some fund practices
continue to operate in the country. These include the Support and Price Stability Fund (SPSF) operating
within the budget and the Defense Industry Support Fund (DISF), Social Solidarity and Support Fund
(SSSF), Promotion Fund, Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF), Privatization Fund, and Turkey Wealth
Fund operating outside the budget.
